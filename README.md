### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset
### Titanic Dataset

### Overview
Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset repository! This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic ship. Through this analysis, we seek to gain insights into the demographics of passengers, survival rates, and factors that influenced survival. The findings from this EDA can provide valuable historical perspectives and serve as a learning exercise for data analysis.
